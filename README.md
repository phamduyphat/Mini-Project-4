## Introduction

This project implements an airline reservation system using Python. It allows users to manage flights, book reservations, cancel bookings, and view flight details. The system is designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and provide a practical application of these principles.

## Program Structure

The system is built around several interconnected classes:

1. `Flight`: Represents individual flights with attributes like flight number, destination, departure time, total seats, and booked seats.
2. `Seat`: Manages individual seats within a flight, including availability status.
3. `Passenger`: Stores passenger information such as name, age, and passport number.
4. `Reservation`: Links passengers to specific flights and seats.
5. `AirlineSystem`: Manages the overall system, including adding flights, booking/canceling reservations, and viewing flight details.

The main program flow is controlled by the `auth()` function, which handles user login and signup. The `if __name__ == "__main__"` block provides the main menu-driven interface.

## Key Components

- `Flight` class:
  - Attributes: flight_number, destination, departure_time, total_seats, booked_seats
  - Methods: book(), cancel(), view_details()

- `Seat` class:
  - Attributes: seat_number, seat_type, is_available
  - Method: is_available()

- `Passenger` class:
  - Attributes: name, age, passport_number
  - Method: get_passenger_info()

- `Reservation` class:
  - Attributes: flight_number, seat_number, passenger
  - Methods: get_flight(), get_seat_number(), get_passenger()

- `AirlineSystem` class:
  - Methods: add_flight(), book_flight(), cancel_reservation(), view_flight_details()

## OOP Concepts Utilized

* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation (use of private attributes and getter/setter methods)
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism (method overriding or overloading)

## Challenges Faced

1. Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling for various scenarios.
2. Data Management: Efficiently storing and retrieving flight and reservation data.
3. User Interface: Creating an intuitive command-line interface.
4. Security: Ensuring proper authentication and protecting sensitive user data.
5. Scalability: Designing the system to accommodate potential future expansions.
6. Performance: Optimizing performance for large datasets and frequent operations.
7. Testing: Thorough testing of edge cases and error conditions.

## Installation and Usage

To run this program:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
